# Week7Challenge-Fruit-Stand

Ujwal needs a web site for his fruit stand just south of Baltimore. The web site must contain a home page which displays to the customers which fruit is available each day as well as the hours the stand is open each day.

- Monday - Strawberries
- Tuesday - Blueberries
- Wednesday - Cherries
- Thursday - Plums
- Friday - Bananas
- Saturday - Peaches
- Sunday - Watermelons
Hours: 10am to 6 pm daily. Open 10am until 7pm on weekends.

When a customer clicks on the day of the week they should be taken to a page which displays that day, the hours for that day only and the fruit available. Along with a picture of the fruit.

The schedule, including the hours, must be displayed on the home page. But Ujwal likes to modify the fruit of the day and the hours (depending on his mood) so he has hired and admin to update the daily fruit and the hours. The admin needs a page to update the hours and fruit of the day.

The customers want pictures of the fruit stand, the available fruit and a map of the location to be displayed on the front page. Fruit is purchased weekly and the selection changes often. Images of the fruit offered must be displayed and must be editable from the admin's web page as well.

The website to be published to Heroku because the fruit stand doesn't make very much money selling fruit and has to use cheap-free hosting. Hint: Develop with MySQL but use PostGreSQL when pushing to Heroku since Heroku doesn't support MySQL.

The instructions for pushing to Heroku with PostGreSQL are in the packets Lesson 25. Highlights are in the assignment below.
